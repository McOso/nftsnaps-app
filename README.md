# ðŸ’¨ NFT Snaps
Disappearing NFTs


#### Spin Up

The `pnpm` CLI is the recommended package manager.

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### Development
```bash
pnpm dev
```

#### Build
```bash
pnpm build
```


### What is this??
This is a simple proof of concept for NFTs that disappear after a certain amount of time. Anyone can create a NFT Snap and share with the world. Anyone is able to collect (mint) a Snap but the image and metadata visibility will expire.

- Collecting a Snap is only open for 24 hours after creation
- A Snap is only visible for 48 hours after creation
